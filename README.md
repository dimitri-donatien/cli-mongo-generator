- **bin** â€” is where your CLIâ€™s lives. Itâ€™s what gets called when someone runs your CLI.

- **src/commands** â€” holds individual command files. This makes adding new commands or editing existing ones cleaner.

- **src/utils** â€” is for utility functions you might need across several commands, like formatting data.

- **src/lib** â€” could be where your core functionality resides, especially if your CLI interacts with APIs or performs complex logic.
